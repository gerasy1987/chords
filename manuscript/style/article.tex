\section{Introduction}

As the name suggests, Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a framework for sampling by chain-referral.
RDS is a bundle of a sampling mechanism and analysis methods, most common in the study of marginalized populations which do not lend themselves to simple sampling \citep{heckathorn_respondent-driven_1997,heckathorn_respondent-driven_2002}. 

In RDS seeds are selected -- usually by convenience -- from the target population, and given coupons. 
They use these coupons to recruit others, who themselves become recruiters. 
Recruits are given an incentive, usually money, for taking part in the survey, and also for recruiting others.
This process continues in recruitment waves until the survey is stopped, usually when a target sample size is reached.

With the above sampling mechanism, highly connected individuals will be overrepresented in the sample.
If the attribute of interest is correlated with an individual's degree, as is often the case (e.g. HIV), \naive estimates will be biased towards the state of the highly connected subgroups.
An unbiased Horowitz-Thompson-type estimator \citep{horvitz_generalization_1952} would require the knowledge of frequency of each degree. 
Clearly, the frequency of each degree will also be biased towards higher degrees, and thus cannot be recovered from the knowledge of individuals' degrees alone. 
The common remedy to this matter is the inverse-degree weighting heuristic \citep{crawford2015hidden,guntuboyina2012impossibility}.

In \cite{berchenko_modeling_2013} we proposed a generative model for RDS.
The model is based on the idea that RDS spreads like an epidemic, and we can thus borrow epidemiological generative models. In particular SIR [TODO: add citation], for likelihood based inference.
Having assumed a generative process, we can now estimate degree frequencies, introduce covariates, check the goodness of fit, and discuss the model's assumptions. 

The details of the assumed generative model can be found in \cite{berchenko_modeling_2013}, but the essentials are now detailed for completeness.

Denote $N_k$ the unknown population frequency of degree $k$, i.e., the number of individuals with $k$ ``friends''. 
Denote by $x_t$ the degree of the respondent recruited at time $t$. 
Our task is to estimate $\hat{N}_1, \hat{N}_2,\dots$, based on a sample of $x_{t_1},\dots, x_{t_\tau}$. 
Denote $\lambda_{k,t}$, the probability of recruiting an individual with degree $k$ at time $t$. 
We assume the following generative multivariate counting model:
\begin{align}
x
\end{align}
