  title = {Modeling and {{Analysing Respondent Driven Sampling}} as a {{Counting Process}}},
  abstract = {Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is an approach to sampling design utilizing the networks of social relationships that connect members of the target population to facilitate sampling by chain referral methods. Although this leads to biased sampling (such as over-sampling participants with many acquaintances), most RDS studies typically measure each participant's degree, and under the fundamental RDS assumption (that the probability to sample an individual is proportional to his degree) use inverse-probability weighting in an attempt to correct for this bias. However, this assumption is tenuous at best, and should be avoided. Here we suggest a completely novel approach for inference in RDS which compensates for such problems by using a rich source of information that is usually ignored - the precise timing of recruitment. Our new approach, adapting methods developed for inference in epidemic processes, also allows us to develop new estimators for properties such as the prevalence of a disease and the total population size, as well as to test the assumption of recruitment proportional to degree. We find these estimators asymptotically consistent and normally distributed. This new approach thus has the potential to greatly improve the utility of data collected using RDS.},

  abstract = {For a quarter of century, mathematical models have been used to study the spread and control of HIV amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to the end of 2010 and reviewed this literature to summarise the methodologies used, key model developments, and the recommended strategies for HIV control amongst MSM. Of 742 studies identified, 127 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies employed deterministic modelling methods (80\%). Over time we saw an increase in model complexity regarding antiretroviral therapy (ART), and a corresponding decrease in complexity regarding sexual behaviours. Formal estimation of model parameters was carried out in only a small proportion of the studies (22\%) while model validation was considered by an even smaller proportion (17\%), somewhat reducing confidence in the findings from the studies. Nonetheless, a number of common conclusions emerged, including (1) identification of the importance of assumptions regarding changes in infectivity and sexual contact rates on the impact of ART on HIV incidence, that subsequently led to empirical studies to gather these data, and (2) recommendation that multiple strategies would be required for effective HIV control amongst MSM. The role of mathematical models in studying epidemics is clear, and the lack of formal inference and validation highlights the need for further developments in this area. Improved methodologies for parameter estimation and systematic sensitivity analysis will help generate predictions that more fully express uncertainty, allowing better informed decision making in public health.},

Special cases are time-continuous Markov chains on finite state spaces, birth and death processes and models for survival analysis with censored data. The model is termed nonparametric when \ensuremath{\alpha} is allowed to vary arbitrarily except for regularity conditions. The existence of complete and sufficient statistics for this model is studied. An empirical process estimating \ensuremath{\beta}i(t) = \ensuremath{\int}t 0 \ensuremath{\alpha}i(s) ds is given and studied by means of the theory of stochastic integrals. This empirical process is intended for plotting purposes and it generalizes the empirical cumulative hazard rate from survival analysis and is related to the product limit estimator. Consistency and weak convergence results are given. Tests for comparison of two counting processes, generalizing the two sample rank tests, are defined and studied. Finally, an application to a set of biological data is given.},

The exposition of the theory is integrated with careful presentation of many practical examples, almost exclusively from the authors' own experience, with detailed numerical and graphical illustrations. Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes may be viewed as a research monograph for mathematical statisticians and biostatisticians, although almost all methods are given in concrete detail to be used in practice by other mathematically oriented researchers studying event histories (demographers, econometricians, epidemiologists, actuarial mathematicians, reliabilty engineers and biologists). Much of the material has so far only been available in the journal literature (if at all), and so a wide variety of researchers will find this an invaluable survey of the subject.

The model postulates that the data are obtained from a finite population by selecting successively without replacement and with probability proportional to some measure of size. Unlike the ppswor scheme in survey sampling, it is assumed here that the size measure is a function of the unknown population values. In this article, we consider maximum likelihood estimation of the finite population parameters under this biased sampling model. We study the large sample behavior of the MLE's and derive a simple, asymptotically efficient approximation to the MLE. The approximate MLE is structurally similar to the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. We show that information about the order in the sample can be used to make inference even when the population size is unknown, which in fact can be estimated. Small sample behavior of the estimators is investigated through a limited simulation study, and the results are used to analyze oil and gas discovery data from the North Sea basin.},

  abstract = {Since 1985, community outreach efforts to combat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the United States have overwhelmingly depended on a provider-client model that relies on staffs of professional outreach workers. We report on a comparison of this traditional outreach model with an innovative social network model, termed "a peer-driven intervention" (PDI). The latter provides IDUs with guidance and structured incentives that permit them to play a much more active role in the outreach process, thereby harnessing peer pressure on behalf of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention efforts.We compare the performance of a traditional outreach intervention (TOI) and a PDI that were implemented in medium-sized towns in eastern and central Connecticut. Comparisons are based on the number and representativeness of IDUs recruited at each site, the effectiveness of HIV prevention education, compliance rates with AIDS risk reduction recommendations, and relative cost. The analyses are based on 522 initial interviews and 190 six-month follow-up interviews conducted during the first two years of each intervention's operation.Both interventions produced significant reductions in HIV risk behaviors, as measured using self-reports. The PDI outperformed the traditional intervention with respect to the number of IDUs recruited, the ethnic and geographic representativeness of the recruits, and the effectiveness of HIV prevention education. In addition, the costs of recruiting IDUs into the intervention and educating them about HIV in the community was only one-thirtieth as much in the PDI as in the traditional intervention.The findings suggest that given guidance and nominal incentives, IDUs can play a more extensive role in community outreach efforts than the traditional model allows. The findings also suggest that both interventions reduce HIV-associated risk behaviors, but the PDI reaches a larger and more diverse set of IDUs, and does so at much less expense.},

  abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a network-based technique for estimating traits in hard-to-reach populations, for example, the prevalence of HIV among drug injectors. In recent years RDS has been used in more than 120 studies in more than 20 countries and by leading public health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Despite the widespread use and growing popularity of RDS, there has been little empirical validation of the methodology. Here we investigate the performance of RDS by simulating sampling from 85 known, network populations. Across a variety of traits we find that RDS is substantially less accurate than generally acknowledged and that reported RDS confidence intervals are misleadingly narrow. Moreover, because we model a best-case scenario in which the theoretical RDS sampling assumptions hold exactly, it is unlikely that RDS performs any better in practice than in our simulations. Notably, the poor performance of RDS is driven not by the bias but by the high variance of estimates, a possibility that had been largely overlooked in the RDS literature. Given the consistency of our results across networks and our generous sampling conditions, we conclude that RDS as currently practiced may not be suitable for key aspects of public health surveillance where it is now extensively applied.},

RDS data are collected through a snowball mechanism, in which current sample members recruit future sample members. In this paper we present RDS as Markov chain Monte Carlo importance sampling, and we examine the effects of community structure and the recruitment procedure on the variance of RDS estimates. Past work has assumed that the variance of RDS estimates is primarily affected by segregation between healthy and infected individuals. We examine an illustrative model to show that this is not necessarily the case, and that bottlenecks anywhere in the networks can substantially affect estimates. We also show that variance is inflated by a common design feature in which the sample members are encouraged to recruit multiple future sample members. The paper concludes with suggestions for implementing and evaluating RDS studies.},

The method has significant advantages over other sampling methods, including the possibility that representativeness samples can be accrued. However, the requirements for a respondent-driven sample to achieve representative and to demonstrate its superiority over other methods are quite strict. This report focuses on whether the accompanying paper by Ramirez-Valles et al. fulfills these requirements in terms of the theorems underlying RDS regarding sample recruitment rates, referral patterns, and network sizes. Further, it investigates the assertion that the accrued sample has proven that RDS is superior to more traditional time-location or venue-based sampling methods. Unconvinced that either is the case, the author suggests a method to test if RDS is indeed the gold-standard recruitment strategy for obtaining inclusive and representative samples of hidden populations.},

  volume = {137},
  abstract = {Capture-recapture methods in epidemiology analyze data from overlapping lists of cases from various sources of ascertainment to generate estimates of missing cases and the total affected. Applications of these methods usually recognize the possibility of, and attempt to adjust for, nonindependent ascertainment by the various sources used. However, separate from the issue of dependencies between sources is the complexity of within source variation in probability of ascertainment of cases, e.g., variation in ascertainment by population subgroups, such as socioeconomic classes, races, or other subdivisions. The authors present a general approach to this issue for the two-source case that takes account of not only biases that arise from such \dbend{}variable catchability\dbend{} within sources but also the separate complexity of dependencies between sources. A general formula, (K - ?)/(K + ?), is derived that allows simultaneous calculation of the effects of variable catchability, ?, and source dependencies, ? upon the accuracy of the two-source estimate. The effect of variable catchability upon accuracy and applications to data by race on the neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington's disease, are presented. In the latter analysis, multiple different two-source estimates of prevalence were made, considering each source versus all others pooled. Most of the likely bias was found to be due to source dependencies; variable catchability contributed relatively little bias. Multiple poolings of all but one source may prove a generally efficient method for overcoming the problem of likely variable catchability, at least when there are data from many distinct sources.},

To achieve the goal of reducing HIV infections in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in cooperation with state and local health departments, implemented the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) for injecting drug users (IDUs) in 25 selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) throughout the United States in 2005. The surveillance system used respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a modified chain-referral method, to recruit IDUs for a survey measuring HIV-associated drug use and sexual risk behavior. RDS can produce population estimates for specific risk behaviors and demographic characteristics. Formative assessment activities-primarily the collection of qualitative data-provided information to better understand the IDU population and implement the surveillance activities in each city. This is the first behavioral surveillance system of its kind in the U.S. that will provide local and national data on risk for HIV and other blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections among IDUs for monitoring changes in the epidemic and prevention programs.},

  abstract = {Adequate surveillance of hard-to-reach and 'hidden' subpopulations is crucial to containing the HIV epidemic in low prevalence settings and in slowing the rate of transmission in high prevalence settings. For a variety of reasons, however, conventional facility and survey-based surveillance data collection strategies are ineffective for a number of key subpopulations, particularly those whose behaviors are illegal or illicit. This paper critically reviews alternative sampling strategies for undertaking behavioral or biological surveillance surveys of such groups. Non-probability sampling approaches such as facility-based sentinel surveillance and snowball sampling are the simplest to carry out, but are subject to a high risk of sampling/selection bias. Most of the probability sampling methods considered are limited in that they are adequate only under certain circumstances and for some groups. One relatively new method, respondent-driven sampling, an adaptation of chain-referral sampling, appears to be the most promising for general applications. However, as its applicability to HIV surveillance in resource-poor settings has yet to be established, further field trials are needed before a firm conclusion can be reached.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Respondent-driven sampling is a novel variant of link-tracing sampling for estimating the characteristics of hard-to-reach groups, such as HIV prevalence in sex workers. Despite its use by leading health organizations, the performance of this method in realistic situations is still largely unknown. We evaluated respondent-driven sampling by comparing estimates from a respondent-driven sampling survey with total population data. METHODS Total population data on age, tribe, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual activity, and HIV status were available on a population of 2402 male household heads from an open cohort in rural Uganda. A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey was carried out in this population, using current methods of sampling (RDS sample) and statistical inference (RDS estimates). Analyses were carried out for the full RDS sample and then repeated for the first 250 recruits (small sample). RESULTS We recruited 927 household heads. Full and small RDS samples were largely representative of the total population, but both samples underrepresented men who were younger, of higher socioeconomic status, and with unknown sexual activity and HIV status. Respondent-driven sampling statistical inference methods failed to reduce these biases. Only 31\%-37\% (depending on method and sample size) of RDS estimates were closer to the true population proportions than the RDS sample proportions. Only 50\%-74\% of respondent-driven sampling bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals included the population proportion. CONCLUSIONS Respondent-driven sampling produced a generally representative sample of this well-connected nonhidden population. However, current respondent-driven sampling inference methods failed to reduce bias when it occurred. Whether the data required to remove bias and measure precision can be collected in a respondent-driven sampling survey is unresolved. Respondent-driven sampling should be regarded as a (potentially superior) form of convenience sampling method, and caution is required when interpreting findings based on the sampling method.},

Using Lindsay and Roeder's (1992, Journal of the American Statistical Association 87, 785-794) mixture model results and the EM algorithm, a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of F for any specified population size N is obtained. Then, the nonparametric MLE of the (N, F) pair and thus for N is determined. Perhaps most importantly, since our MLE pair maximizes the likelihood under the entire nonparametric probability model, it provides an excellent foundation for estimating properties of estimators, conducting a goodness-of-fit test, and performing a likelihood ratio test.

  abstract = {Objective To estimate the numbers of female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Salvador, El Salvador.Design and methods A capture\dbend{}recapture exercise was conducted among MSM and FSW in San Salvador in 2008. The first capture was done by distributing key chains to both MSM and FSW populations through local non-governmental organizations (NGO) that work with these groups. The second capture was done during the course of an integrated behavioural and biological survey (IBBS) using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The proportion receiving a key chain estimated from the IBBS study was adjusted by RDS-derived weights.Results The first capture included 400 FSW and 400 MSM. Of the 624 MSM interviewed in the IBBS, 36 (5.8\% crude; 3.2\% adjusted RDS) had received the key chain. The estimated population size of MSM in San Salvador was 12?480 (95\% CI 7235 to 17?725). Of the 663 FSW interviewed in the IBBS, 39 (5.9\% crude; 6.9\% adjusted RDS) had received the key chain. The estimated number of FSW was 5765 (95\% CI 4253 to 7277).Conclusions The capture\dbend{}recapture exercise was successfully linked to an IBBS to obtain city-level population sizes for MSM and FSW, providing valuable information at a low cost. Size estimates are crucial for programme planning for national AIDS programmes, NGOs and stakeholders working with these populations and for HIV projection models.},

  title = {The use of auxiliary variables in capture-recapture modelling: an overview},
  volume = {29},
  abstract = {I review the use of auxiliary variables in capture-recapture models for estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. capture probability, population size, survival probability, and recruitment, emigration and immigration numbers). I focus on what has been done in current research and what still needs to be done. Typically in the literature, covariate modelling has made capture and survival probabilities functions of covariates, but there are good reasons also to make other parameters functions of covariates as well. The types of covariates considered include environmental covariates that may vary by occasion but are constant over animals, and individual animal covariates that are usually assumed constant over time. I also discuss the difficulties of using time-dependent individual animal covariates and some possible solutions. Covariates are usually assumed to be measured without error, and that may not be realistic. For closed populations, one approach to modelling heterogeneity in capture probabilities uses observable individual covariates and is thus related to the primary purpose of this paper. The now standard Huggins-Alho approach conditions on the captured animals and then uses a generalized Horvitz-Thompson estimator to estimate population size. This approach has the advantage of simplicity in that one does not have to specify a distribution for the covariates, and the disadvantage is that it does not use the full likelihood to estimate population size. Alternately one could specify a distribution for the covariates and implement a full likelihood approach to inference to estimate the capture function, the covariate probability distribution, and the population size. The general Jolly-Seber open model enables one to estimate capture probability, population sizes, survival rates, and birth numbers. Much of the focus on modelling covariates in program MARK has been for survival and capture probability in the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and its generalizations (including tag-return models). These models condition on the number of animals marked and released. A related, but distinct, topic is radio telemetry survival modelling that typically uses a modified Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model for auxiliary variables. Recently there has been an emphasis on integration of recruitment in the likelihood, and research on how to implement covariate modelling for recruitment and perhaps population size is needed. The combined open and closed 'robust' design model can also benefit from covariate modelling and some important options have already been implemented into MARK. Many models are usually fitted to one data set. This has necessitated development of model selection criteria based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) and the alternative of averaging over reasonable models. The special problems of estimating over-dispersion when covariates are included in the model and then adjusting for over-dispersion in model selection could benefit from further research.},

If scale-up-based methods routinely produce higher estimates, this would suggest that scale-up-based methods are inappropriate for populations most at risk of HIV/AIDS or that standard methods may tend to underestimate the sizes of these populations.},

  abstract = {This article examines the ethical implications of using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to conduct HIV behaviour surveillance among injection drug users (IDUs) in Chicago. Ethnographic inquiry illustrates how the design and implementation of RDS invites if not promotes manifold violations of federal guidelines governing human research subject protections.Post hoc structured interviews with approximately 13\% (n=70) of the behaviour surveillance sample (N=529) focused on how RDS's "dual incentive" structure affected participants' social, economic, and cultural milieu. Triangulated methods include interviews with owners of 20 "shooting galleries", unofficial and illegal locales where IDUs congregate and 400 h of traditional ethnographic observation of individual IDUs and IDU networks. "Consensus analysis" allows identification of key cultural domains that define the RDS coupon market.The study reveals the power of RDS to foment a stratified market of research participation that reinforces pre-existing economic and social inequalities among IDUs. Participants co-opted RDS to develop various "underground" revenue-generating modalities that produced differential risks and benefits among participants. Deleterious outcomes include false advertising regarding the study's risks and benefits, exploitation of relative economic deprivation, generation of sero-discordant social networks, and interpersonal and organised conflict, coercion, and violence.Although RDS may involve serious ethical violations it remains the best available means for accruing a representative sample of hidden populations. It is critical, however, to supplement RDS with research into (1) the subjects' cultural, social, economic, and political contexts, (2) the potential human subjects violations that participants experience, and (3) how these two issues might affect data integrity and interpretation.},
